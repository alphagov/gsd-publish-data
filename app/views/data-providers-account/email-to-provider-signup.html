        Hello
      </p>

      <p>
        As of next month, we are making some changes to the process of publishing data for Transactions Explorer. We will be:
        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>publishing a new set of metrics â€” see the updated <a href="service-manual">Service Manual</a> for more details</li>
          <li>asking for data to be published monthly rather than quarterly</li>
          <li>allowing services to publish data directly to us, rather than through a department contact</li>
        </ul>
      </p> 

      <p class="panel panel-border-wide">
        To get started, <a href="create-account">set up an account</a> using your work email address. From the account you will be able to delegate data publishing to others, and edit historical data.
      </p>
      
      <p>  
        If you are unsure about the changes, feel free to <a href="mailto:performance@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">contact the team</a> with any questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks,
